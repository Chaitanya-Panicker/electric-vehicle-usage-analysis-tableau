## 📖 Project Overview  
The world is accelerating toward a greener future, and **Electric Vehicles (EVs)** are at the heart of this revolution.  
This project leverages Tableau to visualize the **distribution, adoption trends, and performance metrics** of EVs across regions, manufacturers, and models.  

By transforming raw EV registration data into **insight-rich visuals**, we uncover the patterns shaping the EV market — from the most popular models to state-level adoption rates.  

---

## 🔍 Key Visualizations  
- **Total Vehicles Registered** — Overall EV adoption scale.  
- **Average Electric Range** — Understanding EV efficiency.  
- **Breakdown of BEVs vs PHEVs** — Market composition analysis.  
- **EV Distribution by State** — Mapping adoption hotspots.  
- **EVs Over Model Years** — Tracking adoption trends over time.  
- **Top 10 Vehicle Makers** — Identifying market leaders.  
- **CAFV (Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle) Eligibility** — Policy-driven adoption insights.  
- **Top Vehicle Models** — Consumer preferences revealed.  

---

## 💡 Insights & Analysis  
- **5,220 total EVs** recorded, with **PHEVs (5,034)** vastly outnumbering **BEVs (186)** — signaling hybrid dominance.  
- **Toyota**, **Chevrolet**, and **BMW** lead the EV market, collectively making up over **47%** of all vehicles.  
- The **PRIUS PRIME** alone represents **48%** of registered EVs, highlighting strong brand loyalty.  
- States like **California** and **Washington** emerge as EV adoption hubs.  
- Average electric range is **26.88 km**, suggesting scope for battery range improvements in many models.  
- **66% of vehicles are not CAFV eligible**, indicating that incentives are yet to reach the majority of owners.

## 🛠 Technologies Used  
- **Tableau** — Data visualization and dashboard creation.  
- **Excel/CSV Dataset** — EV registration and technical data.  
- **Geospatial Mapping** — Tableau map layers for state-wise distribution.

## 📂 Project Steps  
1. **Data Collection** — Gather EV registration dataset with details on model, range, and eligibility.  
2. **Data Preparation** — Clean and format dataset for Tableau.  
3. **Dashboard Design** — Create KPIs, charts, and maps to visualize EV metrics.  
4. **Analysis** — Identify patterns in EV adoption and performance.

## 🚀 How to Use  
1. Clone this repository.  
2. Open the Tableau dashboard file (`Tableau Project File.twb`).  
3. Use filters (State, Model Year, CAFV Eligibility) to customize analysis.  
4. Explore model-wise, maker-wise, and region-wise EV trends interactively.
